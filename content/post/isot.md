I am very honored to give a talk at the ISOT, an international olfaction conference that happens every 4 years. I presented in the "From physics to olfaction" along with Massimo Vergassola, Peter Latham and Ila Fiete. The conference was originally scheduled in June but was delayed until August due to Covid-19. This is my first virtual talk, and I was pleasantly surprised to see 80+ attendees for our sessions.
