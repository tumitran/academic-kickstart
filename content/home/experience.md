Through studying artifical systems, I hope to understand how biological systems process smells.

  description = """Using RNA interference, we can knockdown genes one-by-one to see which one activates a cellular pathways. However, the process is not accurate, since for every gene we knockout, we also knockout a lot of unintended targets. I engineered cells genetically in order to separate the sources of on-target and off-target knockout. This disentanglement of these two sources allow experimental results to be better interpreted."""
