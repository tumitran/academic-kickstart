  description = """Using RNA interference, we can knockdown genes one-by-one to see which one activates a cellular pathways. This technique is used to identify drug targets. However, the knockdown process is not accurate, meaning for each gene we perform the knockout experiment, we also knockout a lot of unintended targets. This makes it hard to interpret the results. I altered the cells genetically using CRISPR technology to separate the sources of on- and off-target, aiding the analysis of these experiments."""
