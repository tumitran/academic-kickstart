Mammalians smell odorants using an emsemble of olfactory receptors. I trained a neural network to replicate the evolution of these receptors by treating 3D convolutional filters as "receptors" and 4D tensors as "molecules". Through studying artifical systems, I hope to understand how biological systems process smells.
